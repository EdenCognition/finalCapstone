## Book management program

I developed this book management program to demonstrate strong understanding of Python and SQLite3

### Project decription

* The program has been created for demostratative puproses only
* The program is subject to HyperionDev Capstone Project

### How to run this program

1. Using your prefered method, copy 'Book_Management_Program.py' & 'books.db' into your prefered (Python3.9 or above friendly) computing environment
2. To examine the code:
   - Prompt 'Book_Management_Program.py' & 'books.db' into your favourite IDE
   - You may want to update your Python version to enable SQLite3 import
   - Apply your favourite test techniques to examine the code
   - Run the program one you are fully satisfied with the code stack

### Program capability

The program has been develeped to answer the following options: 
Program options in running order are:
   1. Add book
      - Adds a new row into books database
   2. Update book
      - Updates book's quantity
   3. Delete book
      - Removes one row from the database table 
   4. Search book
      - Checks for specific book ID and returns the information about the book

### Addtional notes

* If the 'books.db' is missing or note copied over, the program will create a new one and populate 5 default book entries
* If the 'books.db' is present but is empty, then the program will populate 5 default book entries too 


Thanks in advance
